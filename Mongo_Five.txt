========> REPLICATION  <========

NOTE 1: Replication is a process to synchronize data across multiple servers
 NOTE 2: Replication increases data availability
 NOTE 3: Replication protects data from different kind of problems like server destroying.
 NOTE 4: By using replication, DB service can work constantly
 NOTE 5: Most of the times 3 replications are enough but if you want you can create more.
         Every server is called "Node" as well
 NOTE 6: When you update or maintain DB, everytime primary one is selected and one of the secondary one is assigned to be primary.
         When you complete the update or maintainance, all updates are reflected to the other copies. Updated one is assigned as secondary node.
